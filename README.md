## FreeCodeCamp challenges

The challenges that I do with FreeCodeCamp in the Javascript curriculum are in the `freecodecamp` directory:

| Exercise Numbers      | Category                     |

| 1-107                 | Basic JavaScript             |
| 108-133               | ES6                          |
| 134-165               | Regular Expressions          |
| 166-177               | Debugging                    |

| 198-213               | Basic Algorithm Scripting    |

## Boot camp exercises

Exercises taken from Kaitlyn's boot camp files are in the `react-course` directory. These exercises are done in the context of learning React.

## Other

Exercises done from other sources are floating around for now, because there is currently only one file: `2019-10-09-js-exercises.js`, which contains work on some exercises from [the book _Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Edition_ by Marijn Haverbeke](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).
